# Neuronize
Neuronize v2 is an application focused in interoperability between different ways to represent the neuron
morphology, mesh or tracing. Specifically the tool can obtain a tracing file readable by Neurolucida from a
VRML file generated by Imaris filament tracing plugin from Imaris.

In addition the tool can generate a neuronal mesh from a tracing file, including spines, and generate a
plausible soma from the data included in the input tracing file or from a soma mesh generated by Imaris.
